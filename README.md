# Docker Compose For WordPress With XDebug
This is a docker compose setup for WordPress with XDebug and PHPMyAdmin. It's my standard development environment for WordPress.

Place the plugins you want mounted in WordPress container to the ./plugins/ folder of the project.

Added empty plugins folder to the project so hold the plugins that will be mounted in the WordPress container.
